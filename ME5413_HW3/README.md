# Task 3 - Path Planning using Bidirectional A* Algorithm

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements a **Bidirectional A* Algorithm** for path planning on a given grid-based map.  
It calculates the shortest path between predefined locations and computes a **distance matrix**.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Bidirectional A***: Efficient path search using two-way exploration.
- **Custom Heuristic**: Weighted Euclidean distance for better performance.
- **Distance Matrix Calculation**: Computes shortest paths between key locations.
- **Visualization**: Displays the planned path on the grid map.

## ðŸ›  Dependencies
Before running the notebook, install the required Python packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
